{title:Title}

{phang}{cmdab:iemargins} {hline 2} Plots estimated marginal levels of outcome variables across treatmtent groups.

{title:Syntax}

{p 4 6 }
{cmdab:iemargins} {it:dependent_variable_list} {break}{p_end}
{p 4 6 }
  , {opth t:reatment(varname)} {break}
  [{opth c:ontrols(varlist)}] {break}
  [{opt graph:options(list_of_options)}] {break}
  [{help regress:regress_options}]

{pstd}The {bf:treatment()}  variable must be categorical,
and can have as many groups as you like. {break}
The {bf:graphoptions()} option accepts both {help twoway_options:twoway}
and {help marginsplot} styling options.{p_end}

{title:Description}

{pstd}{cmdab:iemargins} This command calculates the predicted levels
of any number of outcome variables for each treatment group.
They are displayed in an array of graphs for quick visualization of
the size of differences between various treatment arms in a experiment.
